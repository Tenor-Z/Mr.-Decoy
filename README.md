A Micro:Bit "worm" that reproduces itself via radio frequency
It is technically a worm since it randomly finds other micro:bit microcontrollers with the built in radio, but there is no important
code being run on these devices half of the time, so is a worm really that harmful to it?

Even though it uses a strange amalgamation of Javascript, it did a good job introducing me to the language and
writing this was fun as fuck
